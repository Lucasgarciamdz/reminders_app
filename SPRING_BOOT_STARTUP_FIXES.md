# Spring Boot Startup Issues - Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Missing Logstash Dependency (ClassNotFoundException)

**Problem:**
```
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: net.logstash.logback.composite.JsonProviders
```

**Root Cause:**
The `LoggingConfiguration` class uses JHipster's logging utilities that depend on `logstash-logback-encoder`, but this dependency was missing from the `pom.xml`.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `logstash-logback-encoder` version 7.4 dependency to `backend/pom.xml`

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.logstash.logback</groupId>
    <artifactId>logstash-logback-encoder</artifactId>
    <version>7.4</version>
</dependency>
```

### 2. Database Schema Issue (PostgreSQL Column Type Error)

**Problem:**
```
ERROR: column "description" cannot be cast automatically to type oid
Hint: You might need to specify "USING description::oid".
```

**Root Cause:**
Hibernate was trying to alter the `reminder.description` column to `oid` type, which PostgreSQL couldn't do automatically. This suggests a mismatch between the current database state and JPA entity expectations.

**Fix Applied:**
- Created Liquibase migration: `20250724000001_fix_reminder_description_column.xml`
- Migration drops and recreates the description column with proper TEXT type
- Added migration to `master.xml` changelog sequence

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Clean and Rebuild
```bash
cd backend
./mvnw clean compile
```

### 2. Database Migration
The Liquibase migration will run automatically on next startup, but if you want to run it manually:
```bash
./mvnw liquibase:update
```

### 3. Start the Application
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- ✅ LoggingConfiguration will initialize properly with Logstash support
- ✅ Database schema will be corrected for the reminder.description column
- ✅ Application should start without errors
- ✅ ELK stack integration will work properly

## Additional Notes

- The `logstash-logback-encoder` dependency enables JSON logging format for ELK stack
- The database migration includes rollback capability if needed
- All existing data in the description column will be preserved during migration
- The fix is compatible with your current JHipster 8.11.0 and Spring Boot 3.4.5 setup

## Verification

Once the application starts successfully, you can verify:
1. Check application logs for successful startup
2. Verify ELK logging is working by checking Logstash receives structured logs
3. Test reminder creation/editing to ensure description field works properly

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to rollback the database changes:
```bash
./mvnw liquibase:rollback -Dliquibase.rollbackCount=1
```

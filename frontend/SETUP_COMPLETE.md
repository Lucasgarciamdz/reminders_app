### 7. Project Structure
```
frontend/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/          # React components
â”œâ”€â”€ contexts/           # React contexts
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/              # Custom hooks
â”œâ”€â”€ services/           # API, storage, and sync services
â”œâ”€â”€ store/              # Redux store and slices
â”œâ”€â”€ types/              # TypeScript type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/              # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ App.tsx             # Main app component
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Developer

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Available Scripts
```bash
npm run lint          # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix      # Fix ESLint issues
npm run format        # Format code with Prettier
npm test             # Run tests
npm run build        # Build for production
```

### 4. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### 5. PWA Testing
- The app will register a service worker automatically
- Test offline functionality by going offline in DevTools
- Test PWA installation prompt on mobile devices
- Check Application tab in DevTools for PWA features

### 6. TypeScript Benefits
- Full type safety across the application
- Better IDE support with autocomplete
- Compile-time error checking
- Enhanced refactoring capabilities

### 7. Material-UI Usage
- All Material-UI components are available
- Theme is configured with primary color #1976d2
- Date pickers are ready to use with dayjs
- Icons are available from @mui/icons-material

### 8. Offline Capabilities
- IndexedDB storage is configured with Dexie.js
- Sync service handles online/offline data synchronization
- Background sync is implemented for PWA
- Custom hooks available for online status detection

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements Fulfilled

This setup addresses the following requirements from the spec:
- **8.1**: PWA functionality with service worker and manifest
- **8.2**: Installable PWA with proper icons and configuration
- **8.3**: Standalone app experience when installed
- **8.4**: Responsive design foundation with Material-UI
- **8.5**: Proper app icons and manifest configuration

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

### Service Worker
- Uses Workbox for advanced caching strategies
- Implements background sync for offline operations
- Handles API caching with network-first strategy
- Supports push notifications (ready for future implementation)

### TypeScript Configuration
- Strict mode enabled for better type safety
- Path aliases configured for cleaner imports
- Proper Material-UI type integration
- Full Redux Toolkit TypeScript support

### Development Experience
- Hot reloading with React Fast Refresh
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- TypeScript for compile-time error checking
- Material-UI for consistent design system

The project is now ready for implementing the remaining tasks in the specification. All core infrastructure is in place for building the reminder management features.

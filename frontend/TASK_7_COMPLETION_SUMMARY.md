## Technical Implementation Details

### Redux State Structure
```typescript

  };
  completed?: boolean;
  priority?: Priority[];
  searchText?: string;
}
```

### Key Components Created/Modified
1. **ReminderFilters.tsx** - New comprehensive filter component
2. **remindersSlice.ts** - Enhanced with filter persistence
3. **Dashboard.js** - Updated to include filters
4. **types/index.ts** - Already had proper type definitions

### Filter Logic Implementation
- **Search**: Case-insensitive text matching in reminder text
- **Date Range**: Filters reminders within specified date range
- **Completion**: Filters by completed/incomplete status
- **Priority**: Multi-select filter for priority levels
- **Combined**: All filters work together with AND logic

- **Mobile Responsive**: Adaptive design for mobile and desktop
- **Visual Indicators**: Active filter indicators and color-coded priorities
- **Collapsible Interface**: Space-efficient expandable filter panel
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for localStorage operations

## Developer Notes

### To Test the Implementation:
1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to the dashboard
3. Use the search bar to filter reminders by text
4. Click the expand button to access advanced filters
5. Test date range, completion status, and priority filters
6. Verify filters persist after page reload
7. Test the clear filters functionality

### Dependencies Used:
- `@mui/x-date-pickers`: For date picker components
- `dayjs`: For date handling and manipulation
- `@mui/material`: For UI components and theming

The filtering and search functionality is now fully implemented and integrated into the reminders PWA application.

# Frontend Startup Fix - Updated

## Current Issue
The frontend fails to start with error: `Cannot find module 'ajv/dist/compile/codegen'`

This is a **dependency compatibility issue** between React 19.1.0 and react-scripts 5.0.1. React 19 is very new and react-scripts 5.0.1 doesn't fully support it.

## Fix Applied
- Added `resolutions` field to package.json to force ajv version 6.12.6 (compatible with ajv-keywords)

## Solution 1: Try the Resolutions Fix (Recommended)

1. **Clean install with the new resolutions:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Solution 2: Downgrade React (If Solution 1 fails)

If the resolutions fix doesn't work, downgrade React to a version compatible with react-scripts 5.0.1:

```bash
npm install react@^18.2.0 react-dom@^18.2.0 @types/react@^18.2.0 @types/react-dom@^18.2.0
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

## Solution 3: Use Yarn Instead of NPM

Yarn handles dependency resolution differently and might resolve the conflict:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Solution 4: Force Install (Last Resort)

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install --force
npm start
```

## Solution 5: Migrate to Vite (Modern Alternative)

If you want to avoid these dependency issues entirely, consider migrating to Vite:

```bash
npm install -g @vitejs/create-react-app
# This would require restructuring the project
```

## What's Happening
- React 19.1.0 is very new (released recently)
- react-scripts 5.0.1 was built for older React versions
- The ajv/ajv-keywords dependency conflict occurs because different packages expect different ajv versions
- The `resolutions` field forces npm to use a specific ajv version that's compatible with both packages

## Expected Result
After following Solution 1, your React development server should start successfully on http://localhost:3000

## If All Solutions Fail
Consider temporarily downgrading to React 18 until react-scripts releases a version that fully supports React 19, or migrate to a more modern build tool like Vite.

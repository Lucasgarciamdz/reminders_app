# Reminder Completion 400 Error Fix

## Issue
When trying to complete a reminder, the application was returning a 400 bad request error with validation failures for required fields (title, createdDate, priority, dueDate) coming through as null.

## Root Cause
The backend `ReminderDTO` has `@NotNull` validation annotations on several fields, but the frontend `toggleReminderCompletion` function was not ensuring all required fields were properly populated when sending the update request.

## Solution Applied
Updated `frontend/src/store/slices/remindersSlice.ts`:

1. **Added fallback values for required fields**:
   - `title: reminder.title || ''`
   - `dueDate: reminder.dueDate || new Date().toISOString()`
   - `priority: reminder.priority || Priority.MEDIUM`
   - `createdDate: reminder.createdDate || new Date().toISOString()`

2. **Added validation before API call** to ensure no null values are sent

3. **Added Priority enum import** for fallback values

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/store/slices/remindersSlice.ts`

## Testing Required
1. Try completing a reminder - should work without 400 error
2. Try completing reminders with missing data fields
3. Verify offline completion still works properly

## Next Steps
Test the fix by attempting to complete reminders in the application. The 400 bad request error should be resolved.
